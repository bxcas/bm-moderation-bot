## üìå Overview
The **BattleMetrics Moderation Bot** is designed to allow trial staff to submit **mutes, kicks, bans, and lift bans** without requiring full access to **BattleMetrics** or other moderation tools. 

### How It Works:
- **Trial staff** submit moderation actions through Discord forms.  
- Actions remain **pending for approval** until reviewed by **verified staff**.  
- Verified staff can **accept, deny, or create a discussion thread** for further review.  
- The bot integrates exclusively with **BattleMetrics** and requires a **BattleMetrics RCON Subscription** to function.  

### Additional Features:
- **All bot actions are logged** in a dedicated `Logs` folder for full transparency and record-keeping.  
- Uses **BattleMetrics API** to ensure secure and efficient moderation.  



If you need assistance, contact **bxcas** on Discord.
